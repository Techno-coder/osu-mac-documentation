To point osu!macOS Agent to your osu! install location:

1. Open osu!macOS Agent
2. In the **Location** field, point to the location of your osu! install.

.. tip::

    Your install location should be pointed towards ``osu!.app``. For example, my install location is ``Users/Adrian/Desktop/osu!.app`` (you shouldn't need to `escape <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_character>`_ the exclamation mark)

You should now be ready to get started with osu!macOS Agent.
