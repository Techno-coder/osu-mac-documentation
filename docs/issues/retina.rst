If you use the default **Mac driver** for osu! (see `Setting up your screen options <../10.14/screen.html>`_ **and** have a `Retina display <https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202471>`_ you might like to enable Retina mode to:

- have osu! appear at your native resolution
- reduce frame drops and lag

To enable Retina Mode:

1. Locate where ``osu!.app`` is installed
2. Right click on it and select **Show Package Contents**
3. You should now see three files/folders: ``Contents``, ``drive_c`` and ``Wineskin``. Click ``Wineskin``
4. A window like the one below should pop up. Click **Set Screen Options**

Now, you should now be able to edit your **Screen Options**. Click **Retina Mode**.

To save your changes, click the red circular close icon in the top-left corner of the window, then click **Quit** in the Wineskin window.
